# Citi Bike Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the work completed for the Citi Bike data analysis project. The project involves exploratory data analysis, k-means clustering, time series analysis, and visualization using Tableau.

## Contents

- `data_analysis_notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the data analysis code.
- `Tableau_Storyboard.twbx`: Tableau workbook with the storyboard.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Tableau Storyboard

The Tableau storyboard can be viewed [here]([https://public.tableau.com/views/Your_Storyboard_Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/adewale.omotosho.amao/viz/CitiBike_17218543524940/CitiBike-Analysis)).

## Summary

This project explores the Citi Bike dataset to uncover patterns in bike usage, user demographics, and trip characteristics. Key analyses include k-means clustering to identify user segments and time series analysis of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data.

## Instructions

1. Open `data_analysis_notebook.ipynb` to view the data analysis steps.
2. Open `Tableau_Storyboard.twbx` in Tableau to view the interactive storyboard.
3. Visit the Tableau Public link to view the published storyboard.

## Next Steps

Further analysis can include more sophisticated models, additional data sources, and deeper exploration of seasonal trends.

## Limitations

The analysis is limited by the scope of the available data and the chosen methods. Future work can address these limitations by incorporating more comprehensive data and advanced analytical techniques.
