## 📊 Tableau Storyboard

Explore the interactive Tableau storyboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/adewale.omotosho.amao/viz/CitiBike_17218543524940/CitiBike-Analysis).

## 📝 Project Summary

This project delves into the Citi Bike dataset to reveal insights about bike usage patterns, user demographics, and trip characteristics. Key analyses include:

- **K-Means Clustering**: Identifying distinct user segments based on ride behaviors and demographics.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Analyzing trends in ride counts and exploring correlations with external factors such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

## 📋 Instructions

1. **Data Analysis**: Open `data_analysis_notebook.ipynb` to follow the data preparation, exploration, and analysis steps.
2. **Visualization**: Open `Tableau_Storyboard.twbx` in Tableau Desktop to interact with the data visualizations.
3. **Online Storyboard**: View the published storyboard on Tableau Public [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/adewale.omotosho.amao/viz/CitiBike_17218543524940/CitiBike-Analysis).

## 🚀 Next Steps

Potential future directions for this project include:
- Developing more advanced models to predict ride patterns.
- Integrating additional data sources to enhance analysis depth.
- Exploring seasonal trends and their impact on bike usage.

## ⚠️ Limitations

The analysis is constrained by the available data and the methodologies applied. Future work can address these limitations by expanding the dataset and employing more sophisticated analytical techniques.
